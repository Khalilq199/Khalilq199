## 🛠️ **Technologies & Tools**

**Languages**: Python, C++, C, C#, SQL, Java, JavaScript, Bootstrap, VHDL, MATLAB, RTOS
**Frameworks**: flask, React, Pytorch, Tenserflow, Kubernets, Docker, OpenCV, LiveKit, Node.js, BigQuery, Looker Studio 
**Software**: Git, GitHub, Linux, AutoCAD, SolidWorks,
**Protocolls**: I2C, UART, TCP, UDP

## 🌟 Experiences**

I’m a software and automation engineer focused on building robust, end-to-end systems that solve real-world problems. Most recently at **Untether AI**, I developed a scalable Python automation pipeline that cut multi-day chip screening analysis down to seconds, leveraging Pandas, `.pkl` DataFrames, Git, and Linux-based tools to streamline post-silicon validation. At **IKO Industries**, I used JavaScript, Node.js, and Google BigQuery to optimize internal tool usage, cutting request times by over 30%. I’m also a firmware developer on the **Midnight Sun Solar Car Team**, programming STM32 microcontrollers for power systems and driver controls.

## 🔬 **Passion Projects**

Whether it’s programming an autonomous **pick-and-place robot in C**, building a **Flask-based secure note-taking app**, or experimenting with **AI voice assistants** using FastAPI, OpenAI, and WebSockets, I enjoy blending hardware with software and theory with application. I thrive on breaking down complex systems and delivering clean, scalable solutions from the ground up.

---

## 📊 **Data-Driven Approach**

I use data as a tool for decision-making and debugging. From building analytics dashboards in **Looker Studio** to structuring SQL queries in **BigQuery**, I enjoy turning raw data into insights that improve processes, performance, and clarity across teams.

## 🎯 **What's Next?**

I’m now diving deeper into **real-time systems, embedded development**, and **AI-integrated backend engineering**. I’m always open to collaborations and conversations about building smarter, faster, and more meaningful tech. Let’s connect.
