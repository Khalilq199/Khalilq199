## **Experiences**

Iâ€™m a software and automation engineer focused on building robust, end-to-end systems that solve real-world problems. Most recently at **Untether AI**, I developed a scalable Python automation pipeline that cut multi-day chip screening analysis down to seconds, leveraging Pandas, `.pkl` DataFrames, Git, and Linux-based tools to streamline post-silicon validation. At **IKO Industries**, I used JavaScript, Node.js, and Google BigQuery to optimize internal tool usage, cutting request times by over 30%. Iâ€™m also a firmware developer on the **Midnight Sun Solar Car Team**, programming STM32 microcontrollers for power systems and driver controls.

## **Passion Projects**

Whether itâ€™s programming an autonomous **pick-and-place robot in C**, building a **Flask-based secure note-taking app**, or experimenting with **AI voice assistants** using FastAPI, OpenAI, and WebSockets, I enjoy blending hardware with software and theory with application. I thrive on breaking down complex systems and delivering clean, scalable solutions from the ground up.

## ðŸŽ¯ **What's Next?**

Iâ€™m now diving deeper into **real-time systems, embedded development**, and **AI-integrated backend engineering**. Iâ€™m always open to collaborations and conversations about building smarter, faster, and more meaningful tech. Letâ€™s connect.
